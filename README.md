## WordPress Plugins
I've released numerous plugins, including:

* [External Permalinks Redux](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins/external-permalinks-redux)
* [Redirect to Latest Post](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins/eth-redirect-to-latest-post)
* [Simple Shortlinks](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins/eth-simple-shortlinks)
* [Taxonomy Dropdown Widget](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins/taxonomy-dropdown-widget)
* [WP Revisions Control](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins/wp-revisions-control)

The full list is at [https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins](https://git.ethitter.com/wp-plugins).

**Note:** I use GitLab for all of my development, and mirror the repositories to
GitHub. Feel free to open pull requests against the GitHub repos and I'll push
your branch to GitLab if it's accepted.

## Deploy a WordPress Plugin to WordPress.org from GitLab

Insipired by [10up's tool for deploying a WordPress plugin using GitHub 
Actions](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy), I created 
a similar concept for use with GitLab CI. It's available both as a standalone
[script](https://git.ethitter.com/open-source/wp-org-plugin-deploy) and as a
[Docker image](https://git.ethitter.com/docker/wp-org-plugin-deploy).

## Golang Tools

I dabble with Golang after learning it to build a [better system for running
WordPress's cron system](https://github.com/automattic/cron-control).

* [Monitor and cull stale DigitalOcean droplets created by GitLab Runner](https://git.ethitter.com/debian/gitlab-runner-do-monitor)
* [Client for the dyndnsd daemon](https://git.ethitter.com/open-source/dyndnsd-client)
* [Pipe logfile lines to Mattermost or Slack webhooks](https://git.ethitter.com/debian/eth-log-alerting)
